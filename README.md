# Project Title

MERN User Management Project

Live Project Link - 

This project was developed using the MERN stack. The backend was created using Mongoose, MongoDB, Node, Express, and Cors, while the frontend was developed using React, Axios, and a little bit of vanilla CSS. The MongoDB database uses a global IP address and does not require an .env file, so the project can be run by anyone by following the steps below.

## Stretch Goals

This was a really fun project to build, and there are some small stretch goals that could be implemented:

- Improve the styling to make it more professional
- Add some simple testing
- Implement a search feature that allows users to search the database by name 
- Implement age range limitation when inputting new users (minimum 18, maximum 100) (Schema Validation using Mongo)
- Only allow email input if it contains an "@" symbol (Schema Validation using Mongo)
- Get the project hosted
