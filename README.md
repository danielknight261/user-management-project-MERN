# Project Title

MERN User Management Project

This project was developed using the MERN stack. The backend was created using Mongoose, MongoDB, Node, Express, and Cors, while the frontend was developed using React, Axios, and a little bit of vanilla CSS. The MongoDB database uses a global IP address and does not require an .env file, so the project can be run by anyone by following the steps below.

## Deployment

To deploy this project, please follow these steps:

Backend
Open a terminal

Step 1 - Navigate to the backend directory: cd backend
Step 2 - Run the command: node index

Frontend

Step 1 - Navigate to the frontend directory: cd frontend
Step 2 - Run the command: npm start
Step 3 - The website should load on localhost:3000 and automatically work with the backend server.

Happy Playing!

## Stretch Goals

This was a really fun project to build, and there are some small stretch goals that could be implemented:

Improve the styling to make it more professional
Add some simple testing
Implement a search feature that allows users to search the database by name
Implement age range limitation when inputting new users (minimum 18, maximum 100)
Only allow email input if it contains an "@" symbol
Get the project hosted
